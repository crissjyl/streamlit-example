They have been on the wall 2 days and already peeling from the wall. For the money these are absolutely garbage. I should of read the reviews before I wasted $300 on them. Stay away from this product. Even with following instructions the adhesive is cheap and doesn't stick very well

We are experienced at tiling and renovating houses and figured we would try something simple for a small accent wall in a powder room. We live in Las Vegas so there is no humidity and the tile has not been exposed to any moisture at all. What a mistake. First, the product is almost impossible to work with. The adhesive is incredibly strong and bonds into place as soon as it makes contact with the wall. Unlike regular tiles which can be repositioned to get them level, these pieces bond where they first make contact, so it is almost impossible to get every piece exactly into the correct position.

Unlike regular tiles which can be repositioned to get them level, these pieces bond where they first make contact, so it is almost impossible to get every piece exactly into the correct position. If you have to remove a piece during installation, the piece is not reusable. It disintegrates as the strongest part is the adhesive layer. The tile layer itself is extremely thin and easily cracked. Again, completely different from regular tile. But at least we feel confident that the tiles, once in position, would remain so. How wrong we were. Several weeks after installation, we noticed that small pieces were peeling away from the wall. The wall was professionally primed before installation as per the product instructions but it makes no difference. Increasingly, more and more pieces, even whole sheets, are peeling away from the wall with (ironically) the adhesive layer looking clean as if it had never been used. This means reattaching individual pieces from time to time with regular adhesive. The end result looks extremely amateurish and a complete waste of money. Typically adhesives get stronger overtime. This one starts out incredibly strong and then apparently loses its adhesive properties after a couple of months. Less"
12,Aspect 23.6 in. x 5.9 in. Weathered Quartz Peel and Stick Stone Decorative Tile Backsplash Review:I am so glad that it let me give a rating on this product. This is absolutely the worst thing that I have ever purchased in my life. I wish that I hadn’t put so much of it up on my wall because I couldn’t return it. Please don’t buy this product. It peels away from its own backing. It won’t stick to the wall. It is very uneven. I would give it negative stars if that was possible.
13,Aspect 23.6 in. x 5.9 in. Weathered Quartz Peel and Stick Stone Decorative Tile Backsplash Review:Started falling off about a week after install! This stuff isn’t cheap...we spent around $400 on it and was time consuming to put up...Now I have to get the few tiles that did stick off my walls and repaint.

Weathered Quartz Peel and Stick Stone Decorative Tile Backsplash Review:so.... got this for our RV to give it a more home like feel since we RV full time... we have used Smart Tile before and absolutely loved it. We thought hey lets use this to give us a look we cant get from smart tile and we are extremely disappointed. Smart tile sticks no questions asked. This stuff fell off the wall over night. I mean why should i have to buy another type of adhesive. If that is the case i will put regular tile up... it aint that much weight when you are doing a small backsplash. It was a complete waist of 60 bucks (Yes 60 bucks to do a small job isnt much but you expect the product to work). From now on i will just do Smart tile and be done with it.
15,Aspect 23.6 in. x 5.9 in. Weathered Quartz Peel and Stick Stone Decorative Tile Backsplash Review:I prepped surfaces as told in directions and installed according to instructions. After about three days half the tiles fell off and the other half are stuck on so good that I have to remove with a chisel. My $400 DYI project will now end up being triple that amount to do it right. Don’t claim to be peel and stick if peel and stick isn’t going to work. Biggest waste of time and money I have had in home projects so far. Your tiles looked nice in my dumpster

19,"Aspect 23.6 in. x 5.9 in. Weathered Quartz Peel and Stick Stone Decorative Tile Backsplash Review:We used this product, the weathered quartz stone, as an accent wall in a guest powder room in our home, which is rarely used.

I installed the tiles the next day with little difficulty and the wall, initially, looked very nice. Over the next couple of days, the tiles all began to loosen. After several days of pushing the tiles back into place, I gave up and reinstalled the loosened tiles (probably 30-40% of the total tiles) with adhesive. This was labor intensive and I'm still not sure the remaining tiles will stay in place.I would use this product again, but don't listen to the manufacturer. Just use adhesive on all the tiles."

It took less than an hour to put up, closer to 30 minutes. I think the colors are lighter than I was expecting - I have hoping for more a mix between light and dark, ours is mostly just a few different shades of gray.

I tried the 511 Impregnator sealant that many people recommended for this product and even some harder core ones. None of them protected this from stains or flaking. I didn’t try Polyurethane.

My sample surface has the feel of construction paper. The unaltered sample has soaked up water splashes and is now stained by vegetable oil (see pic). The product would need some sort of sealant applied over it to be functional (and cleanable). Perhaps if I can get a matte clear sealant, this would look fabulous!"

Weathered Quartz Peel and Stick Stone Decorative Tile Backsplash Review:Your product is easy to install, and everyone who has seen the backsplash likes the appearance, the only issue I had was the adhesive backing, it did not adhere to the wall. I cleaned the wall one day prior to installing the Backsplash as per product recommendation, to make sure the wall was dry. Two days after installing tiles the tiles started falling of the wall. I went back to Home Depot and got the recommended adhesive. I have had to reinstall about 75% of the tiles. If the product had suggested using adhesive I would have used it and saved myself a lot of extra work."

It looks great, is very easy to install, and is one of those immediate gratification home improvement products. I cut it using both tin snips where needed for boxing around outlets, and a table saw for long straight cuts. It sticks so well that during installation, once it sticks, it can’t be adjusted or moved, so there’s one chance to get it right. It may be a bit expensive, but compared to buying and installing granite, it’s very reasonably priced, and installation is very quick and easy."

I'd be inclined to use an electric/battery multi-tool to cut it rather than shears, as after a few tile cuts I could see ones hands getting tired/cramped unless scissors being used had a soft grip.

43,Aspect 23.6 in. x 5.9 in. Weathered Quartz Peel and Stick Stone Decorative Tile Backsplash Review:This tile was so easy to put on and it sticks really good! Its beautiful and was surprisingly easy to fit and cut. I used a sheet metal sheers but it wasn't one of the big bulky tools. More like a scissors really. It's real stone but cut really thin so it's lightweight but looks great. I'm impressed by how easy it was to put up and even though I used it in my RV (because its so light weight and flexible so the grout doesn't crack like heavy ceramic tile might when being bounced around on the road) it could easily be used in a house successfully. You can't tell its not expensive ceramic tile or that it wasn't put up by a professional. First time I've ever used something like this and it turned out pretty good (imho).

Basically all you need is a speed square, tin snips and a sharp chisel for cutting out outlet boxes. Overall very pleased with how it turned out. But a few extras. It’s easy to mess up if yours rushing. It helps to have a few spare pieces just in case. I used these to do a side slash for our island. Still waiting on countertops to be installed but we are going to do a black slate backslash once the countertops are installed and these panels on the 2 plain sides of the island are going to compliment it perfectly."

58,"BIKEHAND Bicycle Repair Work Stand For Mountain Road Bike Home Team Maintenance Review:Overall the stand function is okay The problem exists in the vertical extension bar. While the bike is in work position with a bike mounted and you apply pressure as in turning a wrench, the vertical height adjustment starts slipping and the bike slide towards the floor. I can't seem to get it to lock in place for work that requires exertion in a downward pressure. While the bike won't fall it is disconcerting to have this slip occur."
59,"BIKEHAND Bicycle Repair Work Stand For Mountain Road Bike Home Team Maintenance Review:Very solid and well made stand. Super happy with purchase. I'm 6'3"" tall and this stand adjusts higher than I would ever want it to be while still being rock solid. Substantial but still collapses to easily stored size. Haven't used long but materials appear high quality, think wall tubing etc. Tripod legs much better than most stands with just two legs. If I had to complain about something, the frame clamping jaw has to be manually unscrewed a little bit once quick release style lever is flipped to remove frame. I'd say a bargain at this price."

The movement points all work with quick release handles, and slide effortlessly to extend or collapse. It feels like you could hang your car off it not just a bike, it's so sturdy. Tool tray is a nice touch too! Makes it easy to work close to the bike. I was in two minds about spending this much money, and though that a cheaper stand would do the trick, and maybe some would. (I didn't feel like I could justify a ParkTool stand... they are just overpriced if you ask me) But I'm so glad that I went to this price point, and specifically with this product. I'd absolutely recommend this stand to anyone. It seems like the perfect balance between price and functionality."
